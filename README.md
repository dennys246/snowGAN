# The Abominable SnowGAN
The snowGAN is a generative adversarial network built to take in magnified pictures of snowpack and train a generator and discriminator to generate and discriminate pictures of the snow respectively. The end goal is to pre-train an AI that could potentially be rebuilt to assess other things like avalanche risk or wind loading.

This is an actively evolving project, with only 1/2 of the dataset being utilized so far. Over the Spring/Summer of 2025 data preprocessing will be finishing up and the dataset should be released publicly. At that time this project will be updated with thorough guidance for downloading the dataset, pre-trained snowGAN and other models to experiment with in your own pet or professional projects!
